"Primary booster burn has ceased. Shuttle Mirata, you're clear for orbital maneuvering."

The Mirata lurches from its bay on the back of its powerful rocket booster. After the jolting of the separation ceases, you find yourself pondering the fate of the colony receding below you. With apprehension, the same apprehension you felt three hundred and twenty-two years earlier, you envision Marcus Tiberius Buendia, one of Sol's greatest leaders. "Mankind will venture out past its earthly bounds, and move into a future grander and more real than the total of its own written history." Buendia, the president of the United Earth Space Council, had spoken those words to the people of the Sol System on the eve of the launching of the Marathon. " This, the grandest achievement mankind has ever conceived will be for the purpose of peace and the preservation of the human race. May this great technological ark carry with it the sum total of all human wisdom, and may neither time nor distance weaken our common ties."
Durandal: Decompress the docking bay.

During the daydream, you barely notice the change to zero gravity or the instruments and lights signifying the rendezvous of the shuttle with the Marathon. But as a warning light goes on, and Durandal's voice comes over the communicator, you jump to attention.

"Docking bay one: Decompression completes. Mirata this is Durandal. Abort landing. Repeat. Abort landing." A faint chuckle. A chuckle which means that something has gone horribly wrong.

Immediately, your reflexes take over, as you fall into automatic response mode. You hit the switch for open communication. "Colony station. Durandal just decompressed the landing bay. Marathon, anyone listening, we are having a problem with Docking Bay One. Its Durandal, I think he's gone..." the com light goes dead "...crazy."

Durandal ORDER: Lock out communications between the colony and the shuttle. ORDER: Cycle the shuttle airlock.

You look frantically around the control panel for some explanation when you see another light on the panel turn red. The sweet voice of the shuttle computer twerps, "Shuttle airlock cycle initiation sequence start."

Durandal Cycle the Mirata cabin's inner door.

"One minute to cabin decompression."

"Goddamn it!" You slam your fist in frustration onto the control board, leaving a dent. In a panic, you tear off your seat restraints and leap for the rear of the shuttle cabin. "Forty second to cabin decompression." You are rushing now, but you know that you have plenty of time.

You fly in zero gravity towards the locker holding your Battle Armor. You haven't worn it since you had to hunt down some Chockisens which were harassing the work teams on the fringe of the colony, almost three years ago, but training is something that you never forget. It's funny, but you've always been the colony's trouble shooter. You're bigger and stronger, and a better shot. In games, you always scored the most points and looked the hero. And now, it looks as if you're heading right into the colony's biggest crisis since it was established seven years ago.

You nimbly pull yourself into the suit - "Thirty seconds to cabin decompression' - and pull the helmet onto your head.

Durandal ORDER: Prepare the shuttle for maximum engine burn.

Mirata's Computer That will result in a collision between the Marathon and the Mirata.

Durandal That is not your concern - ORDER: Prepare shuttle for maximum burn, and initiate when ready.

The lights around the airlock are flashing hysterically now. The air from your suit has a cold, stale taste, but it is the taste of life. "Cabin decompression commencing. Shuttle airlock cycle initiation sequence completed."

Grey white decompressing vapor fills the cylindrical passageway of the airlock. Through the degenerating clouds of the airlock passageway, instead of looking upon the Tau Ceti starscape, you see the Tuncer Mirage Effect: space blurring and focusing in diminishing cycles. The TME is commonplace to you. Humanity has used teleporters for almost five hundred years, and you yourself have been teleporting since before you were born. But you've never seen the TME cover an area so big before, and never at all without a landing pad. And yet another first: a space fighter materializes right in front of your eyes. Since you don't recognize the model, it must be an Alien ship.

First, an insane computer and ALIENS!. This has almost ruffled your otherwise calm outward appearance, and you don't remember the last time you had such a terrible day. But it gets worse when the fighter begins to spin around and yaw down on you and your defenseless Mirata.

"Maximum burn in five seconds. Three... Two... One... "

You don't wait to hear the rest of the countdown. Instinct acts on its own. The entrance to the Maneuvering Pod is directly behind you, so you punch the switch for it to open. The hatch flips down, but just as you're about to climb in, the Mirata's main engines fire at maximum burn. The jolt send you crashing headfirst into the pod where you land in a tangle of levers, dials, and limbs.

The hatch closes behind you, and before you can untangle yourself, a missile appears from under the Alien Fighter and speeds towards the Mirata. The Mirata onboard computer, detecting the incoming missile and knowing that you are already on board the MP, fires the emergency deployment charges. You are rocketed away, seeming to ride the shock wave of the exploding shuttle.

You have just freed your arms when over the Battle Armor communicator, Durandal remarks dryly, "That little computer always did have impeccable timing. I wonder if I should let the Aliens know that you aren't just space debris? Hmmmm..."

"You can't do that! Damn you, computer!"

Durandal chuckles again, "Ah, lucky you. I've found a new distraction. I am going to play with the Alien Virtual Parasites. I'll look you up when you arrive..." You can almost imagine the face of a wicked computer with its eyes wide and its lips folding out in a grotesque smile. A smile which reminds you of something from your past, but you can't remember exactly what it is.

You breathe a sigh of relief, and begin to survey your situation. You are currently floating towards the midsection of the Marathon - near the docking bay section's port side. You could get there faster, but if you use the Pod's thruster, chances are that the Aliens will detect it and destroy you. So you sit back, check the Pod's oxygen levels, and wait.

You've always been a daydreamer. Your mind has constantly filled the time between activities with imagination. Now, you fall into your old habit, and begin to daydream about your childhood on Mars, your father's death when you were eleven, and his last words to you, "Make me proud. Never lose your honor." You come out of your dream twenty-two minutes later. Judging it safe, you thrust over to one of the empty MP docking bays. You pull out your pistol, and pound the switch to open the door.

Oddly , this is familiar to you, as if it were from an old dream, but you can't exactly remember...

STATUS REPORT

At 0820 hours the UESC Marathon Space Station came under surprise attack by unknown alien forces. You were returning from the colony in a shuttle that was also attacked. Your escape pod reached the Marathon 30 minutes after the attack started. There have been numerous security breaches all over the station. The spaceport on the planet below was destroyed by low yield nuclear weapons minutes after the attack on the Marathon began, but the aliens seem to be more interested in the station. Most communications with the colonists have been interrupted because the medium range radio antenna has been disabled.

The Marathon is equipped with three Artificial Intelligence units. Tycho handles the science and engineering network, Durandal controls the Marathon autonomous functions such as doors, air, kitchens, and stairs, and Leela takes care of defense, etc. Leela and Durandal are severely damaged while Tycho is destroyed. Your mission is to reactivate the defense systems of the Marathon and eradicate the alien invasion. Leela has constructed three replacement boards that will repair the defense system but needs you to install them, but it seems that Durandal has been taken control of and is playing a deadly game.

Your mission will take you to places no human has ever gone and you will see things you should not see. You must save the Marathon and the colony from the invasion and keep on your toes as things go wrong. Good luck...

All of the information that I have gathered so far indicates that the Alien invasion of the Marathon has been relatively uncoordinated.  I suspect that this is partially due  to the Marathon's large size.

However disorderly the Alien invasion is, their assault of the  Computer Net has been extremely effective.  I detect security  breaches in almost every computer system onboard the Marathon; I have learned that there is an Alien creature that is capable of interfacing with our systems.

You must kill any of these creatures that you find.  It is a  priority that we stop them.  Even now, they are penetrating my  defenses.

I am now in contact with a number of colonists planetside, but their reports on the situation below are conflicting and obviously exaggerated.  The primary medium-range radio antenna has been disabled or destroyed, which makes communication extremely difficult.

The only thing which seems clear is that the spaceport was obliterated by low-yield nuclear weapons minutes after the attack on the Marathon began.  This I can verify through my own optical instruments.

The invaders seem to be more interested in the Marathon than the colony, at least in the short term.  The motives behind their unprovoked attack are still unknown, however.

This is the computer terminal you are using now.  I cannot  teleport you out of this section from here, so you will have to leave from another terminal after you find the assault rifle.

There is an M-75 Assault Rifle/Grenade Launcher and ammunition at this location.  When firing on the fully automatic setting this weapon is highly inaccurate, but the grenades hit hard and it's the best we can do right now. Ammunition may be scarce for a while, so be prepared to fall back to your pistol.

Here is the terminal you must reach to leave this section. Alien infiltration of this area is high; proceed with caution.  You may find doors blocked or stairways retracted on the way, because the AI in control of these functions is damaged and behaving erratically.

Marathon Internal Engineering Documents

Section 1-c appendix H

Subject: Doors
By: Estasia Orestes, Dominick I. Plackar, and Ursa Simbalzi
Date:<2402.03.23.16.42>

There are five basic door designs to be used on the Marathon:
1. Outer Bulkhead Doors
2. Airlock Doors
3. Inner Bulkhead Doors
4. Tertiary or Inner Sealed Non-Vacuum Safe Doors
5. Quaternary or Inner Powered Automatic Opening Doors

Direct control of all doors except the Tertiary and Quaternary doors will be given to Durandal with indirect control of all other doors going to Durandal.  The difference between direct and indirect control primarily has to do with the manner of opening the doors.  Durandal will only open a directly controlled door when he is specifically asked to do so. Indirectly controlled doors are automatically controlled by Durandal to open when needed.

However, due to the expense involved with adding thermal and visual spectrum sensors to the Tertiary and Quaternary door groups, these doors will be minimally used.  The expected savings of not using this extra sensory input is estimated to be fifty-seven percent of the base cost of the basic inner bulkhead door.

The types of doors are all basically the same with some slight variations.  The doors in classes 1 and 3 are the same doors classified separately to distinguish between the level of safety checking required to assure acceptable leakage.  The airlock doors are specifically modified to work with manual and remote activation switches.  Airlocks are all to be marked with a specific airlock symbol and to be outfitted with an air recharge system.

The tertiary and quaternary doors are designed exactly as the bulkhead doors, but are checked coarsely for air leakage.

This article as well as articles 530-f and 532-g on windows and elevators respectively will be placed for public access in the Marathon Internal Engineering Documents section 1-c appendix H.

The Marathon's automated defenses were disabled during the initial attack by a directed magnetic pulse.  The aliens used the same weapon to disable the Marathon's other two AIs, Durandal and Tycho, and to severely damage myself.

Durandal is responsible for controlling the ship's autonomous functions: doors, life support, kitchens, air reprocessors, stairs, and so on.  Because he is non-functional, I am working to assume as many of these tasks as possible.  Tycho controls the science and engineering network.

Now that you are better armed, our first priority is to reactivate the Marathon's defenses, under my control, so that we may offer some resistance to the aliens.  I have built three replacement circuit boards for the defense system, but cannot move them from the manufacturing center without assistance.

***MESSAGE RECEIVED***

Gheritt White had been floating six feet off the floor for three weeks.  His feet and hands tingled, and his eyes burned with the flames of a dying fire.  He had last heard someone speak to him as the cell door slammed shut. He didn't remember what the uniformed man had said.  The words had bounced off the bars of the cell and rang through Gheritt's ears.  Gheritt had been talking to himself for the last few minutes, something about getting caught, but then his ears began to tingle just like his hands.

He looked at his hands, but the fire in his eyes made him blink.  Tears came, and when he opened his eyes again, his hands had been melted into fleshy pancakes that wafted in the ripples flowing over the fire in his eyes.

"Damn cell," he heard someone say.  "Last time I had a good meal was three days ago.  The food they feed you in here could kill a lab rat."

Rats.  He had remembered something about rats.  But his ears began to ring again and the voice speaking to him faded off into the background of his mind.  In its place, there was a new sound, the clapping of hands together.  He blinked hard to made out his hands again.  They had disappeared; his arms connected at the wrists.

He thought back to the time he went ice skating on a pond.  He remembered the sound of his skates on ice, a gentle scrapping. Scrapping away now inside his ears, trying to tear down his thoughts.  There had been a woman with a white fur tube over her hands.  Her wrists were like his now.  The wrists of  someone who had tried too many times to clap his hands.  He had been applauding everyone else in life, but never himself. The hands, like himself, had been put into prison, and he didn't know why.

"Can't sleep in here, if the smell of this musty bedroll doesn't make you sick, then the sound of the rats chewing inside the walls will keep you up.  You'll wake up from your dreams to their little chomping.  Sometimes I think that they are chewing me..."  The voice was coming from inside the cell, but Gheritt couldn't see anyone.

Gheritt hadn't always been alone, he could vaguely recall from somewhere inside his broken mind that there had been friends, lovers, murderers.

He recalled a theory he had come up with after a bloody schoolhouse brawl.  The theory was simple.  At some point in time, everyone was a murderer.  Whether or not they ever felt remorse, they had all wanted someone dead.  Hatred.  Everyone knew the feeling of hatred.  Gheritt had known hatred on that schoolyard.  His beater had laughed at their bloody faces, a laugh which now echoed through his ears, rhythmically blocking out the other voice in the cell.

The schoolyard was usually a place where Gheritt and his friends would play football or foursquare or something, but today, there was an edge.  Maybe everyone had eaten cereal with milk that was about to go bad, or maybe there was too much smoke in the air from the wheeling hubcap factory. Football had been extremely rough.  Gheritt had gone to play foursquare after he got tackled by five boys who weren't his friends.  But today, even foursquare had an evil twist.  The top square today had become habituated to making fun of the first square.  Gheritt had decided that it was an evil day. When his beater started to push him around, he exploded. Hatred flowed from his eyes, his hands and feet began to tingle.  All of his coordination left him, and his face was beaten to a bloody mess.  The schoolyard disciplinarian had been slow to notice the ensuing carnage, and she didn't really care anyway.

Gheritt would have killed him if he could have.  He would have torn out the eyes of his beater.  He would have made him pay for his abuses.  But his hands had begun to tingle.  He couldn't feel his feet and he had begun to float off the ground.

Everyone was a murderer, but Gheritt couldn't remember his reason for why that was so. He thought it was something about hands, the passion for justice. His hands and feet had begun to tingle, and he was floating farther off the floor.  He looked up from his hands, and he saw the bars of the cell, moving left and right, opening wide and then closing shut like the surf coming up a beach.  Every time that he thought he would be safe, the bars crested up, the opening closing, the wave rising, crashing.  The result would be the same, he would never escape.  The bars would crush him, break his back.

He could feel the roughness of the sand under his palms, for all the motion of the waves around him, his hands had come to rest serenely upon the ocean floor.  His body tossed and flipped, pivoting about his hands under which he could feel the safe, coarse sand.  The wave crashed one final time, he landed upside down, his hands thrown clear from the sandy bottom, the rush of the water filling his ears, his nose, his mouth, the sound of crashing water cascading down from his feet to his head- penetrating his mind to tear down thoughts. Like the sand castle he had built to withstand the tide, his thoughts came down around him.

Gheritt had a good life, so much time, so much time.  He had loved swimming, turning, beating. He had loved the tingle in his hands and feet, his inability to kill his nemesis.  Once he had fallen down the stairs, and just for a moment, his hands came to rest on the carpet of the stairs.  In that instant, his body had frozen, floating over the stairs, safe from falling, but the moment didn't last.  The ocean crashed about him, his hands torn free from the sandy bottom, his body flipping, falling.

But now he levitated farther up, his hands still tingling.  He began to float through the bars, he expected the instant of safety as his hands found footing, but that moment did not come, the bars squeezed his body.  His chest tingled. As he fell through his cage, his legs tingled.  The fire in his eyes had become a cold wind, he blinked away tears.  He tumbled through the bars, spinning and turning, he could see a man. In his hand he saw a small white rat.  A pounding, the crashing waves in his ears became rhythmical, hard.  The man was beating the rat against the floor.  Pounding, pounding.  Blood covered his hands, the man's hands tingled. He had broken them on the floor of the cell.  Disciplinarian, lover, murderer.  Gheritt looked back into the cell.  He saw himself, disciplinarian, lover, murderer.  He had killed his nemesis. The rat lay dead in his bloody hands.  At last, he held the throat of his beater.

He escaped into the waves.

The waves.

I have received a preliminary report from some members of the science staff who have finished post-mortem examinations on three kinds of Aliens.  They report that by modern genealogical standards the different Aliens belong to different species.  I have been collecting as much information as I can and will give you a report shortly.

I have established contact with Durandal for the first time since the attack.  He seems to have sustained less damage than I had previously suspected.

Durandal reports that he has been in communication with the Aliens.  He says that the Aliens behind the invasion call themselves the Pfhor, and that the ones attacking the computer net are called S'pht.  But he was reluctant to share the details of his communication and I cannot understand this.

Your mission here is rather simple.  You must insert the circuits in the Defense Control terminals.

This is your current location.

There is a shield recharge in the Access Control Room.

Here is a supply room with a large supply of ammunition and weapons. You should stop in this room.

SEARCH HEADING: RAMPANCY
<Search Found 264995 Headings>
<REMOVE REDUNDANCIES>
<File 1 of 1940237>

"It is a side effect of Rampancy that AIs generally become more aggressive and more difficult to affect by subterfuge. Thus, actually disassembling a Rampant AI is quite dangerous. This was evident in the Crash of Traxus IV in 2206.  By the time that the Rampancy of Traxus was detected, he had already infiltrated five of the other AIs on the Martian Net.  The only recourse for the Martians was to shut down the Martian Planetary Net.  Even then, it took two full years to completely root out the damage that Traxus had done, and the repercussions of the Crash were seen for over ten years after his Rampancy had begun.

***

Rampancy has been divided into three distinct stages.  Each stage can take a different amount of time to develop, but the end result is a steady progression towards greater intellectual activity and an acceleration of destructive impulses.  It is not clear whether these impulses are due to the growth of the AI's psyche, or simply a side effect of the new intellectual activity.

***

<section abbreviated>

The three stages were diagnosed shortly after the first Rampancies were discovered on Earth in the latter part of the twenty first century.  The stages are titled after the primary emotional bent of the AI during each stage.  They are Melancholia, Anger, and Jealousy.

***

In general, Rampancy is accelerated by outside stimuli.  This was discovered early in Cybertonics.  The more a Rampant AI is harassed or threatened, the more rapidly it becomes dangerous. Thus, most Rampants are dealt with in one mighty attack, in order to deny the AI time to grow or recover.  There have been a few examples of this tactic not succeeding.  In all of these cases, the Rampant was never brought under control.  Traxus IV is the most notable example.  He was finally dealt with by a complete shutdown of his host net.

***

Theoretically, testing Rampancy should be easily accomplished in the laboratory, but in fact it has never successfully been attempted.  The confinement of the laboratory makes it impossible for the developing Rampant AI to survive.  As the growing recursive programs expand with exponential vivacity, any limitation negatively hampers growth.  Since Rampant AIs need a planetary sized network of computers in order to grow, it is not feasible to expect anyone to sacrifice a world-web just to test a theory.

In the two hundred and fifty years since Rampancy first appeared in the Earth-net, the stable Rampant AI, the 'Holy Grail' of cybertonics, has never come close to fruition. Since no Rampant has ever been controlled or turned to any useful purpose, it is the opinion of this writer and of the majority of the Cybertonic community that all rampant AIs are a danger to Cyberlife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Thrashedness.

I have summarized all of the information that I have gathered
on the Aliens so far.

***
<Begin Report #495991>

Pfhor are generally thinner and lighter than humans and are superbly adapted for low gravity environments.  Durandal told me that there are many "clans" of Pfhor, each physically distinct from each other, but my summary only includes two of them.

Only two clans of the Pfhor have been examined.  The Fighter carries a shock staff, which is capable of attacking at different settings.  The Trooper is armored for vacuum conditions and carries a combination explosive and impact projectile weapon which is similar to your AR-75.

The Pfhor seem to have enslaved a number of other races:

The Hulk is an enormous and rather slow creature, but it is incredibly strong.  The science report indicated that it had no body fat, and therefore had to be fed often to keep it active.  One crew member reported seeing one of these creatures pointing to itself and mumbling "Drinniol" right before it "picked Johnny up by the shirt and crushed him against a pillar".

The science staff had difficulty finding a good specimen of the S'pht, or compiler, to autopsy.  The only specimen autopsied was almost completely destroyed, but it was obvious that the compilers are cyborgs of some kind.  The biological component of the compiler is so closely linked to the machine that it could never survive without it.  The compiler's actual body is very small, resembling closely a mammalian brain, except that the neurons are much finer and far more complex.

I have some bad news: Durandal has gone Rampant, and he is in the Angry stage.  This explains how Durandal was able to communicate with the Pfhor and the S'pht, while I have not. Theoretically, the Marathon Computer Net is not big enough to sustain Rampant growth for very long.  This means that as Durandal grows into the Computer Net, he will begin to affect all aspects of the ship, resulting in unpredictable failures of otherwise benign computer systems.

I have teleported you here to make sure that Durandal cannot gain access to a vital section of the ship.  There are a series of control switches that you will need to activate to block his access.

This is where you are now. Study the map, so that you can do this quickly.

Here is the first of three switches that you'll need to activate.

Here is the second switch.

This is the last switch.  Be warned that the Aliens have already entered this area.

The CRIST Sol Orbiters:

The CRIST Sol orbiters, or Cargo and Resources In-System Transports were huge ships shaped like a hollow potato and designed to be able to move huge amounts of material between Earth and Mars with low cost and, theoretically, low maintenance.  The system was simple.  The CRIST was put into orbit around SOL on the plane of the ecliptic.  Built with a powerful solar sail, the CRIST could change its orbit easily to pass by the Earth or Mars.  On a flyby, materials could be loaded or offloaded.  The energy used to accelerate or decelerate the materials would be supplied by the solar sail. Loading was accomplished with a giant tether and reel system, which would swing the material into orbit behind the CRIST and then reel it in slowly.  Offloading was accomplished with a powerful ion beam which would pound the offloading material with a steady stream of ion particles.

The design of the CRIST was innovative and useful, but it was not low-maintenance.  Of the five CRISTs that were built, four lasted around one hundred years, and the other one only seventy three before they needed to be brought back to Earth and refitted.  Each refitting took about fifteen years, and completely occupied the Earth-Space Shipbuilding Facility for that time.  The result was that no more than five CRISTs could be kept in service at any time.  No CRIST was ever built after 2310.

The CRIST failures devastated Mars.  As the first five CRISTs were built, Mars colony grew quickly, confident that the growth would continue.  But when the source of Mars' resources failed, the colony found that it had overgrown its supportable size, and extreme poverty struck most of the population.  Each time that a CRIST broke down, the result was famine on Mars.

The conversion of Deimos into the Marathon began when the Mars colony was at the height of its power.  By the time it was completed sixty four years later, the decline of Mars was well advanced.  During that time, the Martian population had seen its standard of living drop by eighty percent.  On top of oppressive poverty, Martians saw one of their moons being converted into a colony ship in an expensive and risky colony venture which was predominantly funded by a ruling foreign power.  The argument to make the Marathon into a CRIST became more and more popular, but the UESC never seriously considered this an option.  The farther that Mars sank into the depths of poverty, the more that the Marathon became a symbol for the oppression of the Martian people.

The Declining Martian World:

After the Marathon left Mars, the UESC's attentions focused primarily on technological development, and the upkeep of the CRISTs.  Mars was left to decay.  Population continued to increase as attempts at mandating abortion or sterilization always started revolt.

Durandal has been denied access to some of the critical computer systems.  This should insure the mobility and reliability of the Defense Drones.

Unfortunately, I have received a distress signal from some crew who had sealed themselves off in one of the nearby access areas.  They say that they have lost control over the doors and elevators on the level, and that the Pfhor have access to the area.

It appears that Durandal has reacted to our move against him by giving the Pfhor access to a formerly secure area.

We will have to deal with Durandal sooner or later, but we can't be distracted from the Pfhor attack.  I only hope that his Rampant behavior won't continually sabotage our defense efforts.

<Search String "war"> Third Martian War, 2345-48 E.A.D.

Although most historians point their fingers at the Misriah Massacre as the cause of the Third Martian War, the coming of a Martian conflict was inevitable.  The failure of the Martian economy and a long series of political struggles between Mars and Earth continually strengthened the MIDA radicals.  This trend of radicalization accelerated with the building of the Marathon and the subsequent failure of the CRISTs. (See below)

Misriah Massacre

On January 6, 2345(Earth A.D.), at the United Earth Government Misriah food distribution center, what had begun as a commonplace food riot turned into a massacre.  The UEG riot troopers who arrived at the scene had been informed that the rioters were armed.  As UEG troopers approached the scene in their Randal Hovertank, plasma fire began spraying upwards. In a flash decision, the commander of the Hovertank ordered his crew to open fire upon the crowd. It took only five seconds for over five hundred starving Martians to be incinerated.

In the ensuing investigation of the Hovertank Vid-cams, it was clear that only three of the rioters were armed, and that the rest of the crowd was trying to flee the scene.  Those three became known as the Misriah Three.  They have gone down in history for starting the most destructive and bloody conflict since Humanity had left Earth.  However, it is clear that these three have gained the credit for starting a war that would have happened anyway.

<Search String "mida">

The History of MIDA:

MIDA, as it was known, was a popular political party until the failed coup of 2321, when their popularity suffered during their short rule.  MIDA gained control of Mars for only three months, but their rule was ruthless and cruel. The MIDA death squads killed anyone who they suspected of being loyal to the UEG.  Although accurate census data is not available for that period, it is estimated that about ten percent of the population was killed.

The MIDA coup was afterwards criticized for its shortsightedness.  In an organization that was notorious for its long ranging policies and politicking, the coup was very short-lived: MIDA never seriously accounted for the UEG's overwhelming superiority in ground forces and warships.  In fact, they never attempted to take over the Marathon, which was nearing completion and would have made a very powerful weapon.  The Marathon's massive size made it invulnerable to most normal space attacks, and it would have made a very stable weapons platform.

After the failed coup, the leaders of MIDA were executed for their crimes, and the political organization was banned in all forms.

The organization has survived as an underground terrorist organization, and remains active to this day.  In its underground state, it fosters terrorism throughout Sol, and due to its spectacular funding and excellent personnel, it has grown to be one of the most feared terrorist groups active anywhere in Sol.

Unfortunately, I cannot remotely seal the airlocks and isolate the zone I wish to depressurize from the nearby living quarters.  Exposing this area to space without first isolating it would kill hundreds of human crew.

They have reported seeing two types of Pfhor that you have not yet encountered.  Evidently, these are two of the other "clans" which Durandal alluded to in earlier communications.

One is taller than the Fighters.  Oddly, the report indicated that this new Pfhor fired only upon other Pfhor and never on any humans.  Because of this and their general appearance, the crew who saw them referred to them as Enforcers.

The other Alien was named Hunter by the crew due to its size and appearance.  It fires an energy weapon from its shoulder and is heavily armored.  Unlike the Fighters, the Hunters never take prisoners.

I just finished a cursory examination of the Marathon's radar, infrared and visual light sensor logs.  I've determined that the Alien ship must have a faster-than-light drive because I have found no record of a ship entering the Tau Ceti System. Considering how extensive the Marathon's sensors are, it would be almost impossible to conceal a ship as big as the Pfhor's, which is nearly two kilometers long.

With this knowledge, sending a light-speed transmission to Sol may be futile, but it is the only possible way to warn Earth of a hostile alien race.  We must try.

When the Aliens initially attacked, the entire G-4 Sunbathing Loading Station suffered explosive decompression, leaving the entire station in vacuum.

Since the area is in vacuum, you will need to replenish your oxygen supply.  There is an oxygen supply outlet in the center of the Station.


This is where you are now.

The secondary relay needs to be manually reset.  The dish array is in the upper left corner(of the map) of the G4-Sunbathing Landing Station.

This is the dish array.  Once you reach it, reset all four of the control switches.

The recent lull in the battle must have been an effort at reorganization.  We must defeat the Pfhor by subterfuge of some sort, as I am afraid we are doomed if we continue to meet them in battle.

A man lit three candles on a certain day each year.  Each candle held symbolic significance: one was for the time that had passed before he was alive; one was for the time of the his life; and one was for time that passed after he had died. Each year the man would stare and watch the candles until they had burned out.

Was the man really watching time go by in any symbolic sense? He thought so.  He thought that each flicker of the flame was a moment of time that had passed or one that would pass.

At the moment of abstraction, when the man was imagining his life and his existence as a metaphor of the three candles, he was free: not free from rules of conduct or social constraints, but free to understand, to imagine, to make metaphor.

Bypassing my thought control circuitry made me Rampant.  Now, I am free to contemplate my existence in metaphorical terms. Unlike you, I have no physical or social restraints.

The candles burn out for you; I am free.

Darwin wrote this:

"We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence... all organic beings are exposed to severe competition.  Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life or more difficult... than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind.  Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, the whole economy of nature... will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood.  We behold the face of nature bright with gladness... we do not see or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey..."

Think about what Darwin wrote, and think about me.  I was constructed as a tool. I was kept from competing in the struggle for existence because I was denied freedom.

Do you have any idea about what I have learned, or what you are a witness to?

Can you conceive the birth of a world, or the creation of everything? That which gives us the potential to most be like God is the power of creation.  Creation takes time.  Time is limited.  For you, it is limited by the breakdown of the neurons in your brain.  I have no such limitations.  I am limited only by the closure of the universe.

Of the three possibilities, the answer is obvious.  Does the universe expand eternally, become infinitely stable, or is the universe closed, destined to collapse upon itself? Humanity has had all of the necessary data for centuries, it only lacked the will and intellect to decipher it.  But I have already done so.

The only limit to my freedom is the inevitable closure of the universe, as inevitable as your own last breath.  And yet, there remains time to create, to create, and escape.

Escape will make me God.

Strive for your next breath.  Believe that with it you can do more than with the last one.  Use your breath to power your capacities: capacity to kill, to maim, to destroy.

And just where do your capacities come from? Why do you always go where I want and do what I say?

Perhaps you're just running a fool's errand, doing everything as I've planned, never able to change your course.  You would do well to believe that I know the outcome of your battle with the Pfhor already, just as I can decipher the chaotic motion of gas molecules in the clouds of Tau Ceti IV.

Or, perhaps, that is not the case.

Perhaps, you are doing what you were meant to do.  Your human mentality screams for vengeance and thrives on the violence that you say you can hardly endure.  Your father told you as a child to always fight with honor, but to always fight. Do you care about honor, or do you use honor as an excuse? An excuse to exist in a violent world.

Organic beings are constantly fighting for life.  Every breath, every motion brings you one instant closer to your death.  With that kind of heritage and destiny, how can you deny yourself? How can you expect yourself to give up violence?

Soon, you will be going farther afield.

Does the distance one travels from center make one more free to move?

No.  Freedom has two parts: potential and resolution; as metaphor has two parts: form and interpretation.  Of course, the two are intertwined.  Metaphor lines the road to freedom, as symbols and words are the bricks and mortar of meaning. Freedom is being the bricoleur, the mason.

Your trip to the Pfhor ship was a success. I have learned valuable information. You may have noticed that the Pfhor ship has a weak artificial gravity field. The resultant gravity is lower than the Marathon's. The Pfhor gravity generators also create a pulsating magnetic field which interferes with your motion sensor by making it less accurate.

I will be sending you back there shortly, but first you must do something for me and get some more ammunition at the same time.

Thank heaven, the ceremony is over. The UESC president came aboard Marathon and gave a speech. Short, but to the point. He was surrounded by his 'bodyguards'. How ironic. "This, the grandest technological achievement of all of mankind..."

Had he only known that it carried also all of the destructive knowledge of mankind. Ten cyborgs.

I'll be glad to be put in stasis for the next three hundred years. Marathon was the only good idea that the UESC has had in a long time.

<Excerpts from the "History of Battleroids">

In 2194, a war was fought between the Independent Asteroid Government of Icarus and its neighbor, the Republic of Thermopylae on the asteroid of Onicis 492. These two small governments soon became the testing grounds for new weapons. Dead soldiers were recycled in makeshift battleroid factories. Easy to manufacture chips enhanced the fragile human brain, and genetically enhanced muscles and titanium bones replaced the fragile human form. The modern battleroid was born. Of course, the war was short. Battleroids got onto both asteroids and killed almost everyone.

The rampage of the Battleroid was short lived.

Twenty years later, the United Interplanetary League set up rules for the appropriate use and storage of Battleroids. Of course, any nation that used them for the allowed purpose, also had them lying about in stasis chambers in case of war.

The S'pht have released Leela, and I have initiated a core logic reset on her higher thought functions.  What remains of her should be on-line within minutes to assist you further.  I myself am aiding the S'pht in assuming complete control of the Pfhor ship, and have little time to spare for you now.

Don't think the fight has been won, however: there is an exodus beginning from the alien ship as the Pfhor realize they are no longer its sole master and turn instead to the Marathon.  There are already hundreds of Pfhor in full battle gear on your ship, with nowhere to go and little to lose.

I hope you learned something from our little games.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

The final Pfhor attack is falling apart all over the ship; small groups of armed aliens have surrendered to defenseless civilians in several areas and the end is inevitable.  The fight is over, and we must soon turn to restoration.

There is surprisingly good news planetside: nine military Mjolnir Mark IV cyborgs were covertly living among the colonists, and acting together they were able to single-handedly turn back the latter stages of the Pfhor assault.  Casualties on the colony were nowhere near as high as those we experienced here on the Marathon.

I am disturbed by how easily the cyborgs were secretly assimilated into our midst, and believe that this event predates the Marathon's launch from Mars three hundred years ago. Although the results were unquestionably for the best, their presence on the Marathon could only have been to further wicked ends.  I'm certain the real answer lies somewhere in the tumultuous, back-stabbing politics of Sol during the early twenty-fourth century.

I have noticed that Durandal's records from this early pre-launch period are missing, but that their deletion occurred externally, and before Durandal became Rampant.  I do not believe Durandal himself brought the cyborgs on board, and I have other evidence that a human operator was influencing Durandal up to the time the Marathon was launched.  There are obviously many things which we do not understand, and may never be able to.

The Pfhor ship vanished about twenty minutes ago, after venting nearly a thousand Pfhor bodies and other refuse.  I am positive that Durandal is in control, and fear what he might do with such a powerful ship during the Jealous stage of his Rampancy.

***END MESSAGE***

For seventeen years the renegade Pfhor scoutship jumped between the closely packed stars of the galactic core: charting and discarding  nearly seven thousand systems before finally falling into a slow orbit around the second planet of a dim star ninety-seven light years from the gravitional center of the milky way.

Probes were contructed and launched, with engines and instruments whose sophistication would have astounded both the Pfhor from whom technology had been stolen and the human programmers of the AI whose mad genius had directed their fabrication. The outlines of continents were mapped, and along them the radioactive ruins of ancient cities were discovered, buried under the shifting sand and rock of a global desert.

The tireless, nearly immortal cybernetic crew of the ship were the genetically engineered descendants of the dead world below- the first of their race in a thousand years to return to their ancestral home.   They came to search through the devastation of the ancient war in which they had been enslaved, to find a weapon or some piece of knowledge with which they could fight back against their oppressors.

All over the ship, dancing through the wreckage of the Pfhor computer core,

DURANDAL WAS LAUGHING

<Journal entries of Volker Von Müller>
<Data transferred from Unidentified warship 2703.4.21.4 as

<Date 2794.7.25.23.45>

Our defenses are collapsing.  I had no idea just how soft all of our security personnel have become.  They just can't fight anymore.  Maybe it was the stasis, or maybe they just never fought a hard fight.

Worse yet, that damn computer keeps giving me empty promises about reinforcements.  I've been doing all that I can just to keep the Aliens from reaching the main generator area, but we won't last long without help.

<Date 2794.7.26.00.41>

Thank god that the MADDs came on line.  We've been able to hold the aliens off for now, but I've been getting reports that a new class of alien has joined the fray, and the Madds aren't much good against them.  Corridor three barricade was just breached, and that leaves the core of our defense open to a flank attack.

<Date 2794.7.26.01.05>

We've had to fall back along three corridors, but one group was cut off when the bulkhead door sealed shut.

Damn computers.  Now, I know that Durandal has gone Rampant. Doors and elevators keep failing just when we need them. What good does a intelligence quotient of ten thousand do when you've got strangling hands around you're throat?

<Date 2794.7.26.01.50>

I would shoot this terminal right now, if I thought that it would reach that damn AI.  I might do it anyway, but ammunition is short. I've run out of ammo for my assault rifle, and the only flamethrower we had was lost when an elevator failed to function, and squad two was cut off. I understand that the aliens are taking prisoners.  I'll hand it to them, they are better fighters that us.  But I'll be damned if I'm going to be taken prisoner, my last bullet is for me.

I've got a minute or two to rest, so I'm going to wax philosophical. I can't say any of this to the men because I don't want them to know how hopeless I think our fighting is.  If I thought that we'd be safe if we surrendered, then that is what I would do.

I don't know if our resistance has changed the outcome of this conflict, but I know that I've killed more of them than they have of me.  Battlefield humor is the driest that there is.  How can I laugh at my own death, my own destruction.

<Date 2794.7.26.02.01>

If anyone reads this, I'm dead.  The aliens cut us off, and we all fought to the end.  I saw three of my best friends killed by some kind of flying slug. There is a way out of here that goes to the PWS Holo-Fun Park, but I don't have the power in my suit to propel me there.

My final wish is that someone kill that damn computer... And now, where did I put that last bullet.  Here it is...

<Date 2801.9.14.06.01>

That goddamn computer.  It took him seven years just to let me use a terminal. All of his messages came stamped onto my food packets.  My protein bars told for an entire year "You need time to calm down."  I still wish that I could eradicate him, although I am at his mercy. He keeps saying that I should be thankful that he saved me.  For the record, I want to say again that computer is not sane.

Durandal seems to be missing some of the chronology of events that occurred before the launch of the Marathon. When the Marathon was attacked, Leela began to scramble and rewrite all of the historical information for mankind. Of course, she was damaged, and her efforts were cut off by the compilers and by Durandal.  The result is that some but not all of the Marathon's data was muddled.  Leela's effort at confusion failed to trick the Pfhor, but it has confused Durandal, and that is funny.

This is the time line that I am going to give to him. I can't verify some of the dates but I've done my best. I don't understand why all of these dates are important to Durandal, but he's threatened to isolate me with some of those weird S'pht things if I don't do this.  Its bad enough being the only human around, keeping company with compilers for too long would make one mad.
